# badminton
This is the first C++ program I have ever written with more than 100 lines. In the process of writing this program, I learned the concept of refactoring, the main function of this program is to calculate the score of a badminton game and give the ranking. The main function of this program is to calculate the score of a badminton game and give the ranking. "test1" is the program before refactoring. "Refactoring" is the program after refactoring.

這是我寫的第一個超過100行的C++程式，在寫這個程式的過程中，我學會了重構的概念，這個程式主要功能是計算球賽得分並給出排名。「test1」是重構前的程式。「重構」是重構後的程式。
